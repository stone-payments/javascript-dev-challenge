# Stone Python Developer Challenge

## Presentation

Hello there Stone Candidates!

To better assess you technical skills, we prepared this small challenge as part of our hiring process.

## The Challenge

Create a Dashboard that show Running and Stopped containers from a Docker server, and you should also be able to start, stop, delete that containers and create new ones sending the image name.

Examples of similiar apps are the following:
- [Docker UI](https://github.com/otothea/docker-ui)
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
- [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)


What you must know about the app:
1. Docker should running on your local machine.
2. The integration should be using you local Docker-API.
3. We expect a dashboard to visualize the container and backend that interacts with the Docker API.
4. You can use any frameworks in both the backend and the frontend.

### Checkpoints

Here are some of the checkpoints to guide you through this challenge, you **don't need to do all of them**, but do as much as you can. They **are not** in any particular order, use your analytical skills to prioritize them.

- [ ] Create the backend in Python.
- [ ] Create the endpoints that dashboard will interact with backend. Example: /api/start, /api/stop.
- [ ] Create a Dashboard to show the containers and the controls.
- [ ] Create the following interactions:
  - [ ] Start stopped containers
  - [ ] Stop running containers
  - [ ] Launch new containers
  - [ ] Delete containers
- [ ] Create Instructions how the application can be executed on the README.



## Requirements

You will need to complete the challenge:

- A computer with internet


## Deliverables

The deliverable for this challenge is the code, inside a public GitHub repository of yours. You should provide us the URL for it.

We should be able to deploy your application in our computer, and your ReadME should have all the information necessary for it. 

Send us a report telling how was your experience with this challenge. Even if you can't finish, send the report because for us is more important to know your dedication on a project, thinking and analytical skills, than only looking at your technical skills.
